<% title "Announcing the Community Advisory Group" %>

Since the beginning, Ruby and RubyGems have been maintained and advanced by a small group of passionate volunteers. We have all of them to thank for the large, vibrant community that exists today. However, Ruby has matured to the point where its supporting infrastructure is both vital to the larger internet economy, and can no longer be maintained by a few volunteers. We created Ruby Together to allow Ruby devs and companies to collectively pay developers for their time and effort working on central and critical projects.

That said, our primary goal is to to serve and improve the Ruby community. To assist in that goal, we are proud to announce our new Community Advisory Group (CAG). The Ruby Together CAG will be a collaborative forum where anyone who is passionate about Ruby open source and infrastructure can share and discuss their ideas, opinions, and concerns with each other and with the Ruby Together team. Membership will be open to anyone, whether they are a paying member of Ruby Together or not.

The CAG will have access to current and historical board meeting minutes, and will receive the same updates and briefings as the board of directors. We will actively solicit ideas and feedback in public, quarterly CAG meetings. Issues and suggestions from the CAG meetings will be added to the agenda at each board meeting, and we may invite individuals to address the board to share their thoughts on specific topics.

Anyone who is interested should head over to the [Community Advisory Group signup form](https://groups.google.com/a/rubytogether.org/forum/#!forum/advisory) and join the group.

Working together, we can make Ruby a better place.

The Ruby Together board of directors<br>
